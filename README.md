# JavaScript Individual Challenge

-[x] Describe the abstract steps that you could use again to learn another new language (for example: learning by translation)
-[x] Describe what concrete actions you took whilst learning JavaScript
-[x] Include links to code you have written in JavaScript, for example FizzBuzz, Airport, Thermostat and any another code exercises
-[x] Write up some self-reflections about what went well and what didn't go so well whilst you were learning JavaScript


## Process for learning a new language:
1. Briefly explore the purpose of the new language in the programming world,
highlighting some of the key benefits of the language. This provides some understanding of
the importance of the language in the tech industry and a good start for motivation.
2. Create a list of the aspects covered in programming languages and place them in a logical order
3. Find a trusted and reliable documentation for researching general syntax.
4. This list can then be reordered to suit understanding.
5. Consolidate knowledge by practising using challenges.

## My Approach to learning JavaScript(JS):
1. I followed a learning by translation approach to learning JavaScript
2. Created a list for JS included the below topics:
  - General Syntax rules (curly brackets, use of semi colons at the end of each statement, writing comments)
  - Core Arithmetic
  - Number Methods
  - Variables
  - Keywords
  - Template Literals
  - String concatenation
  - Arrays
  - Conditionals
  - Boolean Operators
  - Loops
  - Object Literals
  - Constructor function
  - Prototypes
  - Class methods
3. Used useful resources online to consolidate knowledge, covering at least all from list above
4. Discussion on topics with peers

The code above includes the code for both FizzBuzz and Thermostat exercises, please check the src and spec folders.

## Self-reflection:
Learning JavaScript has been very educative, I have been able to gain some good understand of how to correctly build a class and get some clearer understanding of using the constructor and prototype in building new functions.

I was able to easily search online and find useful resources when learning JS and I believe the fact that JavaScript is widely used plays a big role in the availability of useful resources.

When building code in JavaScript, I encountered a number of bugs due to syntax errors such as forgetting a semi colon at the end of a pair of parenthesis or forgetting to call a function with () beside the function name (for example - energyUsage();).
